The Smart Supermarket Credit Management System is a web-based application designed to help small supermarkets manage customer credit (kadan) efficiently.
This system replaces traditional notebook-based credit tracking with a simple, digital, and reliable solution.

The project enforces a one-month credit limit, automatically calculates due dates, tracks payments, and highlights overdue customers with alerts. It is developed as an individual academic project with real-world usability.
